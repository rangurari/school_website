    <ul>
        <li>1 kg (8 cups) flour</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 1/2 Tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet of baking powder </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2-3 cups of lukewarm water</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>how to make </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a big mixing bowl combine all 
            dry ingredients. Add water one cup at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Knead with your hands until the dough is
            very loose, sticky, it will be a bit runny
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a towel in
            a warm place and let rise for about an hour.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large saucepan.</li>
        <li>
            Set the bowl of batter to one side of the 
            saucepan and place a paper towel–lined sheet
            pan on the other side. Place a bowl with water next to the batter.
            You want your hands to be wet in order to work with the dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            With wet hands break off a fistful of the batter, and force your thumb
            through the center of the mass. Gently form a doughnut shape
        </li>
        <li>Carefully place the doughnut in the hot oil.</li>
        <li>
            Fry the doughnuts until they are golden brown on 
            both sides. Once both sides are golden brown,
            after just 2 to 3 minutes, transfer 
            the doughnuts to the prepared sheet pan and repeat with more batter.
        </li>
        <li>roll the still-warm doughnuts in granulated sugar.</li> 
    </ol>
